# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice Repository

This repository is a collection of data structures, algorithms, and practice problems that I've solved while studying and brushing up on the basics. The goal is to have a hands-on understanding and implementation of various core concepts in computer science.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following main directories:

- `DataStructuresAndAlgorithms`: This directory contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms.
- `PraticeProblems`: This directory includes solutions to practice problems that are solved using the java implementations of the data structures.

## Featured Implementations

### Data Structures

- Singly Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- HashTable/HashMap

### Algorithms

### Practice Problems

- String Reveral w/ Stack
- Balanced Expressions w/ Stack
- First Non-repeating character in a string
- First repeating character in a string
- Reversing a Queue.

## Usage

Each data structure or algorithm is encapsulated in its own Java class, complete with documentation and a `main` method to demonstrate its functionality with sample test cases.

For example, to test the `StringReverser` class, navigate to the `PraticeProblems` directory and run the following command:

```bash
javac StringReverser.java
java StringReverser
```

This will compile and execute the StringReverser class, displaying the output of the sample test cases provided in the main method.
